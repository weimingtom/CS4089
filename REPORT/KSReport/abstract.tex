The project aims to develop a biometric security system, which can protect
the user's device(s) from unauthorized or unauthenticated access. The idea is
inspired from Microsoft Windows Hello and Google Now, which allows us to speak
our mind and the machine does it, through the profound advancement in machine
learning and artificial intelligence. I plan to implement an Android application
which can recognize the face and the voice of the user, and accordingly allow or
deny access to the system.\\
