\section{Face Recognition}

\subsection{Background and Related Work}
Most of the work in recognition of faces was done by characterizing a face using a set of geometric parametrs , and then performing pattern recognition based on these values. One of the first system to do this is Kanade's face identification system. \\
In Kanade's face identification system \cite{Kanade1973}, all steps of the recognition procedure were automated . This automation used a top-down control strategy with a generic model of expected feature characterstics. This system calculated a set of facial parameters of a single face image and used a pattern classification technique to match it from a known set. This depended primarily on local histogram analysis and absolute gray-scale values, since it was a statistical based approach. \\

\section{Voice Recognition}

\subsection{Background and Related Work}
Speaker recognition is the technique by which a person is identified using the characterstics of their voice biometrics. \\
Speech is a kind of complicated signal produced as a result of several transformations occuring at different levels: semantic, linguistic and acoustic. Differences in these transformations may lead to differences in the acoustic properties of signals. The recognizability of speaker can be affected not only by the linguistic message but also the age, health, emotional state and effort level of the speaker. \\
Background noise and performance of recording device also interfere the classification process. \\
Speaker recognition is an important part of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). As the trend of employing wearable computer reveals, Voice User Interface (VUI) has been a vital part of such computer. As these devices are particularly small, they are more likely to lose and be stolen. In these scenarios, speaker recognition is not only a good HCI, but also a combination of seamless interaction with computer and security guard when the device is lost. The need of personal identity validation will become more acute in the future. Telephone banking and Telephone reservation services will develop rapidly when secure means of authentication are available. \\
