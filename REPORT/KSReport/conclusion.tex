\section{Conclusion}
In this project, I have implemented a face recognition based biometric
security system. It also demonstrates the various capabilities of image recognition
from video sequences. \\
I have also implemented a voice recognition based biometric security system. It demonstrates
the capabilities of speech based recognition from audio sequences. \\
However, several aspects remain to be researched and extended.
For instance, since face to face meeting encompasses several modalities, such as
speech and gesture, these capabilities need to researched and implemented. \\
