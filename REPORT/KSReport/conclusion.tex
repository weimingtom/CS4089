\chapter{Conclusion}

Face recognition uses low-power infrared illumination to obtain robust images under poor lighting conditions, its systems are the least intrusive from a biometric sampling point of view and it is a fairly good biometric identifier for small-scale verification applications. \\
Speaker recognition is attractive because of its prevalence in human day-to-day communication and conversational biometrics provides higher accuracy and flexibility. \\
Hence, a combination of the above two biometric identification system is suitable for a good security implementation. 
However, several aspects remain to be researched and extended.
For instance, since face to face meeting encompasses several modalities, such as
speech and gesture, these capabilities need to researched and implemented. \\
