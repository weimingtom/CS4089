\chapter{Conclusion}

Face recognition is a fairly good biometric identifier for small-scale verification applications. Its systems are least least interrupting from a biometric sampling point of view. Another advantage of this is that, it uses low-power infrared illumination, to obtain rich images under poor lighting conditions. \\
Speaker recognition is also a fairly good biometric identifier. This type of biometric recognition is prevalent in every day communication. This also ensures higher accuracy and flexibility. \\
Hence, a combination of the above two biometric identification system is suitable for a good security implementation. \\
However, several points remain to be researched and extended. \\
For instance, since face to face meeting encompasses several modalities, such as speech and gesture, these capabilities need to researched and implemented. \\
