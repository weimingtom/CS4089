\chapter{Introduction}
Biometric Security is gaining more and more attention recently. This project
attempts to implement an application which can take the voice input from a
microphone, face input from a camera, and verify the authenticity of the user
accessing the system. \\

\section{Motivation}
Human beings have reached a stage where it is no longer convenient to type the
password when they want to be authenticated. This was the basic motivation of
this project, i.e., to replace the password input using a keyboard, and instead
ask the user to smile in front of their personal computer, and talk interactively
to it. Then that personal computer unlocks, if it recognizes the integrity of
the user. \\
Currently, no fool-proof solution exists which attempts to do both these tasks.
There exists individual solutions for each of these individual tasks. But, these
solutions are proprietary and requires specific licenses to use the offered
services. \\

\chapter{Problem Statement}
To design a security system for GNU/Linux operating system using biometric
of the user, i.e., the face and the voice of the user, that would replace the
traditional password input using a keyboard. \\

    Google Now
    This is an artificial inteligent personal assistant, made by Google, using their profound advancement in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The assistant can do various actions, powered by their core serch technology. The most innovating function of this personal assistant is that in a smartphone with Android operating system, the phone can be locked, or unlocked by simply speaking to the smartphone using its microphone.  \\

    Microsoft Windows Hello
    This is one of the authentication technologies used by Microsoft in their Windows operating system. The systems with supported cameras, and other hardware devices, includes improved support for biometric authentication. In this technology, the users show their face to the system camera, thereby allowing the user to be authenticated without the need to send their password. \\

Both the biometric tasks follow a similar approach. First the user face is enrolled. The face-box is detected, the features of this are extracted  and classified into a model. \\
A similar approach is followed for the Voice Recognition part. \\
After both the models are obtained, a combined model is formed using the criteria such that the anomalies of voice recognition can be overcome by the use f face recognition and vice-versa. \\
The obtained model is then used to recognize the authenticity of an already enrolled user.

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Design a function which takes the user voice through the microphone,
%        and the name of the user and returns True or False, accordingly.
%  \item Design a function which takes an image of the user, using the camera,
%        and the name of the user and returns True or False, accordingly.
%  \item Finally, design a system which unifies the functions designed above.
%        The system should be able:
%        \begin{itemize}
%          \item to override the default login screen in a GNU/Linux system.
%          \item to ensure the integrity of the confidential details created
%                using the above functions.
