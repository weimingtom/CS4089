\chapter{Introduction}
Biometric Security is gaining more and more attention recently. This project
attempts to implement an application which can take the voice input from a
microphone, face input from a camera, and verify the authenticity of the user
accessing the system. \\

\section{Motivation}
Human beings have reached a stage where it is no longer convenient to type the
password when they want to be authenticated. This was the basic motivation of
this project, i.e., to replace the password input using a keyboard, and instead
ask the user to smile in front of their personal computer, and talk interactively
to it. Then that personal computer unlocks, if it recognizes the integrity of
the user. \\
Currently, no fool-proof solution exists which attempts to do both these tasks.
There exists individual solutions for each of these individual tasks. But, these
solutions are proprietary and requires specific licenses to use the offered
services. \\

\chapter{Problem Statement}
To design a security system for GNU/Linux operating system using biometric
of the user, i.e., the face and the voice of the user, that would replace the
traditional password input using a keyboard. \\

    This is an artificial inteligent personal assistant, made by Google, using their profound advancement in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The assistant can do various actions, powered by their core serch technology. The most innovating function of this personal assistant is that in a smartphone with Android operating system, the phone can be locked, or unlocked by simply speaking to the smartphone using its microphone.  \\

    This is one of the authentication technologies used by Microsoft in their Windows operating system. The systems with supported cameras, and other hardware devices, includes improved support for biometric authentication. In this technology, the users show their face to the system camera, thereby allowing the user to be authenticated without the need to send their password. \\

\section{The Biometric System}

\subsection{Advantages of Face Recognition}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Face recognition systems are the least intrusive from a biometric sampling point of view because they neither require contact nor the awareness of the subject.
  \item The biometric works with legacy photograph databases, video tape and other image sources.
  \item It is a fairly good biometric identifier for small scale verification application.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disadvantages of Face Recognition}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A face needs to be well-lit by controled light sources in automated face authentication systems.
  \item Face is a poor biometric for use in a pure identification protocol, it performs better in verification.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advantages of Voice Recognition}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Voice is  natural biometric (one that people use instinctively to identify each other) under certain circumstances and machine decisions can be verified by relatively unskilled operators.
  \item The voice biometric requires only inexpensive hardware and is easily deployable over existing, ubiquitous communications infrastructure. Voice is therefor very suitable for pervasive security management.
  \item Voice allows incremental authentication protocols. For example, the protocol prescribes waiting for more voice data when a higher degree of recognition confidence is needed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disadvantages of Voice Recognition}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Speech characterstics can drift away from models with age.
  \item With the improvement of text-to-speech technology improving, it becomes possible to create non-existent identities with machine voices and trainable speech synthesis may make it possible to create an automatic system that can imitate a given saying anything.
  \item Voice recognition is dependent on the quality of the captured audio signal. Speaker identification systems are susceptible to background noise, channel noise, and unknown channel or microphone characterstics.
\end{enumerate}
